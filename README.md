# Initial upload of S-125 received from IALA ARM 2025-06-17

The 20th session of the IALA ARM Committee approved S-125 Edition 1.0.0 and deemed it ready for test implementation. Accordingly, IHO NIPWG is invited to review S-125 Edition 1.0.0, amend it as necessary, and initiate the IHO product specification approval process for the current edition.

NOTE! IHO S-125 is a subset of IALA S-201. A small update to this version of S-125, based on recent changes to S-201 are expected in time for NIPWG 12 (September 2025). At NIPWG 12, a Task group for S-125 will be established. Both IALA and IHO involvement is encouraged.
